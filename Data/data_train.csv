REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Unremarkable.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Today, corrected distance acuities were 20/20 in the right eye
and 20/20 -2 in the left eye.  Color vision was [**7-9**] in both
eyes,
with no red desaturation.  Confrontation fields were full.  A
subtle left relative afferent pupillary defect was noted.  The
eyes were orthotropic in primary position at distance, with full
motility.  Intraocular pressures were 20 mmHg bilaterally.  On
slit-lamp examination, the anterior segment was quiet.  On
dilated fundus examination, she had small, crowded disks with
small cups bilaterally.  Spontaneous venous pulsations were
present in both eyes.  The left optic disk had mild pallor.
Retinal vessels, maculae, and the rest of fundus examination was
unremarkable.

Humphrey visual fields, central 30-2, were full in both eyes.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This patient is status post excision of a
tuberculum sellae meningioma in [**2183**].  Her followup MRI has
shown
tumor recurrence and surgical excision is planned per patient.
The patient's visual acuity, color vision, and visual fields are
intact, though she has subtle relative afferent pupillary defect
and mild optic pallor in the left eye, both of which are
documented in Dr.[**Name (NI) 43879**] notes in [**2183**].  She will return for
postoperative visual fields.

[**Known firstname 449**] finished high school, but had problems in college because
he did not go to class and struggled with some coursework.  He
got into trouble for fighting and damaging property, which he
attributes to being in the wrong place at the wrong time and
hanging out with bad company.  He grew up playing hockey and is
a big fan of the [**Location (un) 86**] Bruins, although he stopped playing a
few months ago because he started working in the evenings.  He
currently works for Papa [**Male First Name (un) 45193**] as a pizza delivery person, and
enjoys it because he gets a lot of freedom and makes good money.
 He previously worked in construction.

[**Known firstname 449**] first got drunk at his high school senior prom.  He drinks
1-2 times a week, and he will consume 2-3 beers in a sitting, or
13-14 beers if he is at a party.  He has felt the need to cut
down his drinking, but denies feeling annoyance, guilt or
requiring an eye opener.  He has driven short distances after
drinking alcohol, but will not drive if he feels that he is too
drunk.  He denies smoking cigarettes, but he has smoked
marijuana although he is not a regular user.  [**Known firstname 449**] started

has never smoked or injected it.  He has also experimented with
LSD, mushrooms, percocets and vicodins, but denies any history
of IV drug use.  He doesn't think that he needs to attend a drug
rehabilitation program, although he expresses some desire to
talk to a counsellor about his substance abuse.  He has been
attending anger management counseling on and off for a few
months.  He denies that the sessions were court-ordered, but
says that he started these sessions at his family's request.
